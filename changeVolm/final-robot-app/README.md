Messing around with the [web audio api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API).

## What's inside

1. **[/press-j-until-the-smiths](https://web-audio-experiments.glitch.me/press-j-until-the-smiths)**: *after a midi version of 'this charming man' loads, pressing j will have it play and randomly draw a shape to the canvas on each frame.*

2. **[/random-pixels](https://web-audio-experiments.glitch.me/random-pixels)**: *after a midi version of 'girlfriend in a coma loads', pressing j will have it play and randomly draw uniform pixels to the canvas on each frame.*

3. **[/frequency-pixels](https://web-audio-experiments.glitch.me/frequency-pixels)**: *after a midi version of 'girlfriend in a coma loads' loads, pressing j will have it play and randomly draw pixels whose shapes are determined by the frequency of the current frame onto the canvas.*

4. **[/high-frequency-erase](https://web-audio-experiments.glitch.me/high-frequency-erase)**: *after a midi version of 'last night i dreamt that somebody loved me' loads, pressing j will have it erase the white depending on the frequency of the song, revealing a photo of the smiths.*
